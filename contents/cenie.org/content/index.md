## Our Founding Principles: The CENIE Promise

ENIE is a new initiative, but it is built on a lifetime of experience. Our approach is grounded in three core principles that guide everything we do.

1. Grounded in Expertise, Driven by Experience
   CENIE was not conceived in a boardroom. It was born from over 30 years of professional experience as a performing artist, a PhD-level academic, and a university professor who has guided thousands of students into their careers. I have lived the challenges our community faces, and I have dedicated my parallel career in technology to building the solutions I wish I had. Our methodologies are rooted in both academic rigor and real-world, on-the-stage practice.
2. Artist-Centric by Design
   We believe technology must serve the artist, not the other way around. Every tool we build, every course we design, and every resource we publish is evaluated through a single lens: Does this empower human creativity? Our commitment is to amplify the artist's voice and vision, ensuring that technology remains a powerful tool in the hands of the creator.
3. A Commitment to Evidence and Evolution
   While we are at the beginning of our journey, we are deeply committed to an evidence-based approach. We will transparently track and share the outcomes of our programs. We will build our success stories with our community, not for them. We invite you to join us in this mission, to contribute to our research, and to help us build the case studies that will define the next generation of the performing arts. This is our promise to you.
