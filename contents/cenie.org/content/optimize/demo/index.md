Excellent idea. The lead capture pages are the most crucial conversion points in this entire funnel. A user who clicks "Schedule a Demo" or "Book an Assessment" is a high-intent, qualified lead. These pages must be frictionless, trustworthy, and compelling to ensure they complete the final step.

Here is a robust design, structure, and copy for the two primary lead capture pages in the `/optimize` section.

**Core Principles for High-Converting Lead Capture Pages**

1. **Laser Focus:** These pages have ONE job: get the user to fill out the form. We will remove all distractions—no main navigation, no footer links to other parts of the site, nothing that allows them to click away.
2. **Reinforce the Value:** The user is here because they are interested, but they may still have doubts. The copy must quickly and powerfully reiterate the value proposition of what they are signing up for.
3. **Minimize Friction:** The form must be as short and simple as possible. We only ask for the information we absolutely need to qualify and contact the lead.
4. **Build Trust:** We will use social proof elements (even if subtle at first) and clear, human language to make the user feel confident and secure.
