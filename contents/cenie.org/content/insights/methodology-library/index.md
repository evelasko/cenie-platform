**(Introduction Section)**

A great artistic or pedagogical idea is not enough. The true challenge lies in transforming that idea into a repeatable, effective process. How do you structure a collaborative devising session? What is the most effective way to teach a complex movement without causing injury? How can you integrate technology into your rehearsals in a meaningful way?

The **CENIE Methodology Library** exists to answer these questions.

Sourced from the innovative work of our Creative & Training Hubs, and curated from a global network of expert practitioners and researchers, this is a living collection of evidence-based frameworks. Each methodology is documented to be clear, actionable, and adaptable to your specific needs.

* **Strategy:** This is the core functional part of the page. It's not just text; it's a tool. The design should be clean and card-based, with powerful filtering options at the top.

**(Filter Controls)**

* **Filter by Discipline:** [Dropdown: `All`, `Movement & Dance`, `Voice & Vocal`, `Acting & Dramatic`, `Directing & Choreography`, `Production & Design`]
* * **Filter by Goal:** [Dropdown: `All`, `Skill Acquisition`, `Injury Prevention`, `Collaborative Creation`, `Technology Integration`, `Audience Engagement`]
* **Search Bar:** [Search Methodologies by Keyword...]

**(Content Grid - Populated with Methodology "Cards")**

* Each card represents a single methodology. For launch, you can start with 2-3 well-documented examples and build from there. Below are placeholder examples demonstrating the structure.
