# The Lab for What's Next in Performance

**Sub-headline:** `Go beyond the traditional rehearsal room. Our Creative Innovation Programs are designed to be a dedicated space for artists to ask "What if?"—providing the framework, mentorship, and collaborative energy to develop the groundbreaking works of tomorrow.`

The greatest leaps in artistic history have always happened when visionary creators were given two things: **permission to experiment** and a **space to focus.**

From the Ballets Russes in Paris to the Black Mountain College in North Carolina, history shows that focused, interdisciplinary "labs" are the crucibles of innovation. This is where new forms are born, where disciplines collide, and where the foundational questions of an art form can be courageously explored.

In our current, fast-paced, and economically precarious industry, this essential space for deep research and development is a luxury few can afford.

The **CENIE Creative Innovation Programs** are our answer to this critical need. We are building a new kind of creative lab—one designed for the unique challenges and opportunities of the 21st-century artist.

## Our Vision: A New Home for Artistic R&D

We believe that the future of performance requires a dedicated space for "Research & Development"—a place where artists can work with the same focus and freedom as innovators in science and technology.

Our programs are built on a philosophy of:

* **Courageous Inquiry:** We prioritize asking powerful questions over finding easy answers. This is a space for bold experimentation, where "failure" is reframed as valuable data.
* **Interdisciplinary Collision:** We believe that true innovation happens when different worlds collide. Our labs are designed to bring together choreographers, directors, technologists, writers, and researchers to spark new connections.
* **Process Over Product:** While incredible work will emerge from our labs, our primary focus is on nurturing a deep, sustainable, and innovative creative *process* for each participating artist.

## **The Program Tracks We Are Building**

We are developing a series of programs to support artists at every stage of their innovation journey. While our first official cohorts are launching soon, this is the framework we are building towards:

### **Innovation Workshops**

*For sparking new ideas.*
These short, intensive workshops will serve as an introduction to our innovation philosophy. Each session will focus on a specific intersection of art and technology—like "Introduction to Generative AI for Choreographers" or "Storytelling with Augmented Reality"—providing a low-risk environment to explore new tools and concepts.

### **Collaborative Labs**

*For developing a concept.*
These project-based labs will bring together small, curated groups of artists and technologists to collaborate on a specific challenge or theme over several weeks. This is where initial ideas are tested, prototyped, and refined in a supportive, feedback-rich environment.

### **Artist Residencies**

*For creating a new work.*
Our flagship offering will be a residency program that provides a select group of visionary artists with the time, resources, mentorship, and focused environment needed to create a significant new work. This will be an opportunity for deep immersion and artistic breakthrough.

## **Who Should Join?**

We are building this for the creators who feel a pull towards the unknown, who see technology as a new color in their palette, and who are ready to help define the next chapter of live performance.

* **This is for you if...** you are a choreographer who wants to explore how data can inform your movement vocabulary.
* **This is for you if...** you are a director who envisions a future where the audience is a dynamic participant in the narrative.
* **This is for you if...** you are a performance artist who wants to build an experience that seamlessly blends the physical and the digital.
* **This is for you if...** you believe that the most exciting work is yet to be made.

The lab is not yet open, but the call for pioneers has begun. Join us.
