# CENIE Final Website Sitemap

**Decision Date:** August 6, 2025  
**UX Strategist Decision:** Based on systematic evaluation of three navigation proposals

## Executive Summary

This sitemap is based primarily on Gladys's outcome-focused navigation structure, enhanced with organizational clarity from Bruce's proposal. The decision prioritizes benefit-driven language, SEO optimization, and clear value proposition communication to serve CENIE's four primary audiences and showcase all seven core initiatives.

## Primary Navigation Structure

### 1. (Learn) Elevate Your Skills

**URL:** `/learn/`  
**Target Audiences:** Performing Artists, Educators  
**CENIE Initiatives:** Academy, Training Exchange Hub  
**Value Proposition:** Professional development and specialized education

#### Sub-Navigation

- /learn/courses/ (The Course Catalog):
  - This is where the detailed information from your original draft will live.
  - It should feature the different tracks (Technology Literacy, Business Skills).
  - Each course should be a "card" with a brief description, duration, and a "Learn More" button.
  - The "Complete Artist Entrepreneur" program should be featured prominently at the top.
  - This page should also include a section on Financial Assistance and the Program Comparison Table.
- /learn/courses/[course-name]/ (Individual Course Sales Pages):
  - Each course needs its own detailed landing page. This is where you do the "hard sell."
  - Content should include: Who this course is for, what you will learn (learning outcomes), course modules, instructor bio, student testimonials (once you have them), format, schedule, price, and a clear enrollment CTA.
- /learn/training-methodologies/ (The Hub Page):
  - This page expands on the mission of the Training Exchange Hub.
  - It should feature articles and resources on pedagogy, evidence-based practices, and research in arts education.
  - It should have a clear CTA for educators and researchers to "Contribute Your Methodology" or "Join the Research Community."
- /learn/resources/ (Free Resources & Lead Magnets):
  - This is a crucial page for top-of-funnel lead generation.
  - It should house your free tutorials, downloadable templates, checklists, and links to register for free workshops.
  - Every resource should be a lead magnet that requires an email address for access, tagging the user for the Academy funnel.
- /learn/assessment/ (The Skills Assessment Tool):
  - A simple quiz (e.g., using Typeform or a similar tool) that asks users about their confidence levels in tech, finance, marketing, etc.
  - Based on their answers, it directs them to the most relevant course or resource, providing a personalized and highly effective user journey.

### 2. (Innovate) Your Art

**URL:** `/innovate/`  
**Target Audiences:** Artists, Choreographers, Directors, Researchers  
**CENIE Initiatives:** Creative Development Hub, Software Suite (Stoomp), Automation Agency  
**Value Proposition:** Creative development and technology integration

#### Sub-Navigation

- /innovate/performance-analysis/ (The Stoomp Sales Page):
  - This is the primary landing page for the Stoomp software. It should be treated like a classic SaaS product page.
  - Content: Headline focused on the core benefit (e.g., "See Your Performance with Unprecedented Clarity"). Features (Movement Quality, Timing Analysis, etc.). Use "Archetype Scenarios" instead of case studies: "Imagine a ballet company reducing injuries..." or "Picture a director improving ensemble timing...". A feature comparison table is excellent here. A very clear CTA to "Start Free Trial."
- /innovate/creative-labs/ (The Programs Page):
  - This page details the concept of the Creative Development Hub.
  - Instead of listing priced residencies, frame them as "Our Program Tracks."
  - Innovation Workshops: Describe the short, introductory workshops. CTA: "See Upcoming Workshops."
  - Collaborative Labs: Describe the concept of bringing artists and technologists together for project-based work. CTA: "Join the Waitlist for Our Next Lab."
  - Artist Residencies (Future Offering): Describe the vision for the residency program. CTA: "Sign up for updates and be the first to know when applications open for our beta cohort." This is honest and builds anticipation.
  - This page should focus on the process and philosophy of innovation at CENIE.
- /innovate/technology-integration/ (The Consulting Services Page):
  - This page is for B2B lead generation (artists or organizations with a specific need).
  - Clearly outline the types of services offered (Individual Artist Consulting, Organizational Transformation).
  - Instead of ROI stats, use benefit-driven language: "What could you achieve with a more efficient workflow?" or "Unlock new creative potential with expert guidance."
  - The primary CTA should be soft and consultative: "Schedule a Free Innovation Consultation" to discuss their project.

### 3. (Optimize) Your Process

**URL:** `/optimize/`  
**Target Audiences:** Industry Professionals, Producers, Directors, Managers  
**CENIE Initiatives:** Software Suite (qAderno, Platea), Automation Agency

  - This is the sales page for qAderno.
  -Focus on the core benefits/outcomes: "Centralize Communication," "Master Your Budget," "Simplify Scheduling."
  -Instead of an exhaustive feature list, use visuals and short descriptions to highlight the experience of using the platform.
  -Use a "Principle-Based Scenario": "Imagine your next production where every team member, from the director to the stagehand, has real-time access to the latest schedule and designs, all on their phone. That's the clarity qAderno provides."
  -CTA: "Schedule a Demo" or "Start a Free Trial" (when ready).

  - The sales page for Platea.
  - Focus on benefits like "Discover Diverse Talent Beyond Your Network," "Streamline Your Audition Process," and "Make Data-Informed Casting Decisions."

- /optimize/workflow-consulting/ (The Agency Services Page):
  - This is the lead-gen page for your consulting services.
  - Outline your process: "1. Operational Assessment, 2. Strategic Roadmap, 3. Implementation Support." This builds trust by showing you have a structured approach.
  - Use benefit-driven language to describe service categories ("Administrative Process Automation," "Marketing Automation").
  - The primary CTA must be soft and consultative: "Book a Free Automation Assessment."
- /optimize/demo/ & /optimize/automation-assessment/ (Lead Capture Pages):
