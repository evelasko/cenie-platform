## Our Translation Mission

### Cultural Bridge-Building Through Scholarship

Language should never be a barrier to academic excellence. Our **Spanish Translation Program** makes essential performing arts scholarship accessible to Spanish-speaking researchers, educators, and students worldwide.

**Our commitment includes:**

- **Professional translations** by subject-matter experts
- **Cultural adaptation** that preserves academic rigor
- **Peer review** of translations by bilingual scholars  
- **Community engagement** in translation priority setting

### Filling Critical Knowledge Gaps

Many foundational works in performing arts studies have never been translated into Spanish, creating significant barriers for Spanish-speaking scholars and limiting cross-cultural academic dialogue.

**We prioritize translations of:**

- **Seminal theoretical works** in theatre and performance studies
- **Contemporary methodologies** in applied and immersive theatre
- **Practice-based research** exemplars and case studies
- **Historical documentation** of performance traditions
