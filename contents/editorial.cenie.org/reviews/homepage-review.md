# Homepage Content Review

## REVIEW SUMMARY

The homepage content successfully captures CENIE Editorial's unique value proposition and maintains strong brand voice consistency. The content accurately reflects all major features from the product brief and provides clear user pathways for all three primary personas.

## CRITICAL FIXES (Must Change)

None identified. All factual claims are supported by the product brief.

## SUGGESTIONS (Should Improve)

- Consider adding specific example titles where "[New Title]" placeholders exist once actual publications are available
- The RAG toolkits section could benefit from a brief explanation of what RAG means for users unfamiliar with the acronym
- Consider adding estimated search time improvements ("seconds vs hours") if metrics become available

## APPROVAL STATUS

**This content is approved.**

The homepage effectively communicates the AI-enhanced publishing value proposition, properly emphasizes bilingual access, accurately represents technical capabilities, and provides clear pathways for all target personas (researchers, authors, librarians). The brand voice is consistently professional, authoritative, and benefit-oriented throughout.
