## Interactive Research Features

### 1. Conversational Search: Your Research Assistant

Go beyond keywords and ask complex research questions in your own words. Our AI-powered search acts as a tireless research assistant, reading through our entire catalog to find the precise information you need.

**How Conversational Search transforms your workflow:**

- **Ask, Don't Search:** Instead of guessing keywords, ask questions like, *"What are the main arguments against postdramatic theatre?"*
- **Get Direct Answers:** Receive synthesized, paragraph-long answers that directly address your query.
- **Save Hours of Skimming:** Spend your time analyzing, not searching. Our AI does the initial reading for you, pointing you to the most relevant sections instantly.

### 2. Guided Discovery: Uncover New Connections

Our platform doesn't just answer your questions—it helps you ask better ones. As you read, our Guided Discovery engine proactively suggests relevant questions, related concepts, and new research pathways you may not have considered.

**How Guided Discovery enhances your research:**

- **Proactive Prompts:** See context-aware suggestions in the margin as you read, prompting deeper inquiry.
- **Conceptual Connections:** Visualize how different theories, practitioners, and performances relate to one another.
- **Serendipitous Discovery:** Surface relevant sources and ideas from outside your immediate field of view, fostering interdisciplinary insight.

### 3. Verifiable AI: Trust Every Source

In academia, trust is non-negotiable. Every answer and insight provided by our AI is accompanied by a direct, verifiable link to the source passage. You can instantly click to view the original context, ensuring complete academic integrity.

**How Verifiable AI builds confidence:**

- **Source-Cited Answers:** Every AI-generated summary or answer includes a clear citation and a direct link to the source paragraph.
- **Visual Grounding:** See the exact text in the original publication highlighted, so you can verify the context and nuance yourself.
- **Eliminate Hallucinations:** Our system is designed to prevent the "hallucinations" common in general AI tools by grounding every statement in our peer-reviewed corpus.

## The Engine: Context Model Protocol (CMP)

### The Foundation of Our AI Technology

These revolutionary features are powered by our proprietary **Context Model Protocol (CMP)**. Traditional academic text is unstructured and opaque to AI. The CMP solves this by embedding a deep layer of semantic metadata into every publication, making the content machine-understandable without sacrificing human readability.

**How CMP makes our AI smarter:**

- **Semantic Tagging:** We don't just index words; we tag concepts, methodologies, arguments, and entities.
- **Relationship Mapping:** The CMP charts the relationships between ideas, citations, and evidence across our entire catalog.
- **Context Preservation:** Our AI understands the context of your query, leading to more relevant and nuanced results.
