# About CENIE: Bridging the Worlds of Art and Code

**Our mission is to build the future artists deserve—one where technology serves creativity, and sustainable careers are the standard, not the exception.**

CENIE was born from a fundamental disconnect I've witnessed my entire life: the world of the performing arts and the world of technology often speak different languages. Tech companies build "one-size-fits-all" solutions that misunderstand the creative process, while arts organizations struggle to keep pace with a digital world that feels alien to their work.

**CENIE is the bridge.**

We are a new, comprehensive ecosystem founded on the principle that the most profound innovation comes from deep, interdisciplinary expertise. We exist to translate the possibilities of technology into the language of art, ensuring that the future of performance is shaped by those who understand it best: the artists themselves.

## The Vision: A Future-Ready Performing Arts Community

Our vision is for a world where artists are empowered to build thriving, sustainable careers on their own terms. Where technology acts as a creative collaborator, not a threat. And where the timeless human connection of live performance is preserved and amplified for generations to come.

**Our Mission**: To make this vision a reality by providing artists and organizations with the essential, artist-centric education, tools, and frameworks they need to navigate the digital age with confidence and creativity.

## The Story: A Lifetime on Two Stages

This mission isn't just a business plan; it's the culmination of my life's work. I have spent over 30 years living in two parallel worlds.

By day, I was a performing artist and academic. Starting at age 10, I dedicated my life to ballet and contemporary dance. I pursued this passion to the highest academic levels, earning a PhD in the choreography and directing of Broadway musicals, and becoming a university professor, where I've had the privilege of guiding thousands of talented students into their professional careers. I have lived the financial precarity, the operational inefficiencies, and the skills gaps that hold back so many brilliant artists.

By night, I was a self-taught technologist. From learning my first programming language at age 10 to mastering Python, DevOps, and AI/ML development, I have always been fascinated by how systems work. I've built mobile apps, designed 3D animations, and created AI agents to solve complex problems.

For decades, these two halves of my life remained separate. CENIE is the moment they come together. I founded CENIE because I believe the future of our industry depends on leaders who are fluent in both languages—art and code. This deep, personal, and lived expertise is the foundation of everything we do.

### Core Values That Guide Our Work

**Artistic Integrity First**: Every technology integration and business innovation must enhance, not compromise, authentic artistic expression and cultural values.

**Evidence-Based Excellence**: Our approaches are grounded in rigorous research, proven methodologies, and measurable outcomes that demonstrate real value for our community.

**Inclusive Global Community**: We actively work to eliminate barriers of language, culture, economics, and geography that prevent talented artists from accessing opportunity and knowledge.

**Collaborative Innovation**: The best solutions emerge from the collective wisdom of artists, technologists, researchers, and industry professionals working together.

**Sustainable Career Focus**: We prioritize solutions that enable long-term career sustainability and personal fulfillment, not just short-term fixes or trends.

## Our Approach: The Bridge Between Art and Code

Our approach is different because our perspective is different. We don't see technology as a solution to be imposed upon art. We see it as a new set of creative tools and strategic levers.

**Our Integration Framework is built on three pillars:**

**Artistry First**: We begin every project by asking artistic questions, not technological ones. What is the creative goal? What is the desired human experience? Technology is then chosen and designed to serve that artistic vision.

**Expertise with Empathy**: Our solutions are designed for artists, with artists. We understand the unique demands of a production schedule, the learning style of a visual thinker, and the practical constraints of an arts organization. This empathy is built into our DNA.

**Building in the Open**: We are at the start of a journey. We don't have all the answers, but we are committed to a transparent, evidence-based process. We will share our successes, our challenges, and our data, co-creating our impact with the community we serve.

## Our Ecosystem: The Seven Pillars of Transformation

To bring this vision to life, CENIE is built as an integrated ecosystem of seven initiatives, each designed to address a critical need within the performing arts community.
