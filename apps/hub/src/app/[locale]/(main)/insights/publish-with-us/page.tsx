          You&apos;ve spent months, perhaps years, on your research. You&apos;ve uncovered a vital
          insight, developed a groundbreaking methodology, or offered a critical new perspective.
          Now comes the most frustrating part: getting it into the hands of the people who can use
          it.
        </p>
        <p className="text-body mb-8">
          The traditional path is paved with obstacles: year-long review cycles, restrictive
          paywalls that limit your readership to a handful of elite institutions, and static PDF
          formats that fail to capture the dynamic, multimedia nature of the performing arts.
