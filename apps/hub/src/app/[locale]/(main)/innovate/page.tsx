          Innovate Your Art: Technology as a Creative Partner
        </h1>
        <p className="text-body-large font-medium mb-8">
          Go beyond the limits of traditional creation. Discover AI-powered tools, collaborative
          innovation programs, and a new framework for integrating technology to amplify your unique
          artistic voice.
        </p>
        <p className="text-body mb-6">
          The next great leap in the performing arts will not come from an algorithm. It will come
          from a visionary artist who learns to use algorithms as a new kind of collaborator.
        </p>
        <p className="text-body mb-8">
          For too long, technology and art have been seen as opposing forces. But the most exciting
          frontier of creation lies at their intersection. AI, advanced video analysis, and
          interactive digital tools are not threats to human creativityâ€”they are the most powerful
          artistic tools to emerge in a generation, waiting for a master to wield them.
