          Learn the Skills to Build a Sustainable Artistic Career
        </h1>
        <p className="text-body-large font-medium mb-8">
          Go beyond your traditional training. Our programs are designed to equip performing artists
          with the essential technology, finance, and business skills needed to thrive in the modern
          creative economy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-body mb-6">
          The paradox of the modern performing artist is that talent is not enough. You can be a
          brilliant dancer, a captivating actor, or a visionary director, but if you don&apos;t
          understand how to market your work, manage your finances, and leverage digital tools, you
          are building a career on an unstable foundation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-body-large font-medium mb-8">
          Traditional arts education prepares you for the craft, but often leaves you unprepared for
          the career.
        </p>
        <p className="text-body">
          At CENIE, our educational mission is to bridge that gap. We don&apos;t teach you your
          artâ€”you are already the expert in that. We provide the crucial strategic scaffolding
          around your talent, empowering you to build a career that is not only artistically
          fulfilling but also financially sustainable and professionally resilient.

          Our Educational Philosophy: Designed for Artists, By Artists
        </h2>
        <p className="text-body mb-8">
          Generic business courses and tech bootcamps fail artists because they don&apos;t speak our
          language. They lack the context, empathy, and pedagogical approach needed for the creative
          mind. Our approach is different because it&apos;s built from the ground up on three core
          principles:
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-8">
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-display-text-medium mb-4">1. Context is Everything</h3>
            <p className="text-body">
              We teach technology and business through the lens of artistic practice. You won&apos;t
              learn abstract business theory; you&apos;ll build a budget for an independent
              production. You won&apos;t learn generic coding; you&apos;ll learn how to use AI tools
              to analyze your choreography.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-display-text-medium mb-4">2. Confidence Before Competence</h3>
            <p className="text-body">
              We know the biggest hurdle is often mindset (&quot;I&apos;m not a business
              person,&quot; &quot;Technology is overwhelming&quot;). Our curriculum is designed to
              build confidence through small, practical, and immediate wins, creating a positive
              feedback loop that makes learning feel empowering, not intimidating.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3 className="text-display-text-medium mb-4">3. Community as the Classroom</h3>
            <p className="text-body">
              Artists thrive on collaboration. Our programs are built around a cohort model,
              connecting you with a network of peers who understand your journey. This community
              becomes a lifelong resource for collaboration, accountability, and opportunity.
