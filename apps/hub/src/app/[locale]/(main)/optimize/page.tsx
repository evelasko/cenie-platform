        <p className="text-body mb-8">
          In the performing arts, our greatest resource is creative energy. Yet, how much of that energy is drained by disorganized communication, inefficient workflows, and the endless administrative tasks required to bring a vision to the stage?
        </p>
        <p className="text-body mb-8">
          <strong>We&apos;ve all been there</strong>: the frantic search for the latest version of the script, the budget spreadsheet that doesn&apos;t add up, the casting process that feels like a shot in the dark. This operational friction doesn&apos;t just cost time and moneyâ€”it costs us our focus and diminishes our creative potential.
