## 🚀 THREE EXECUTION OPTIONS

### Option A: Start Week 1 NOW ⭐ (Recommended)

**What happens**:
- TODAY: Assign agents, begin Week 1 implementation
- WEEK 1: Agents build packages, I create Week 2 cards
- WEEK 2: Seamless transition to Academy/Agency

**Pros**: Fastest time to value, no delays  
**Cons**: Requires active coordination

**Timeline**: Implementation starts TODAY

### Option B: Create All Cards First

**What happens**:
- NEXT 3 DAYS: I create remaining 18 task cards
- DAY 4: Agents start with complete documentation
- 4 WEEKS: Agents execute with no waiting

**Pros**: Complete documentation package  
**Cons**: 3-day delay before implementation starts

**Timeline**: Implementation starts in 3 days

### Option C: Minimal (Week 1 + 2 Only)

**What happens**:
- NEXT 1 DAY: I create Week 2 cards (Academy/Agency)
- DAY 2: Agents start Week 1
- WEEKS 3-4: Cards created just-in-time

**Pros**: Faster start than Option B, more complete than Option A  
**Cons**: Still requires card creation

**Timeline**: Implementation starts tomorrow

## ✨ WHAT I CAN DO NOW

### If You Choose Option A (Start Week 1)

✅ Agents can start immediately with existing cards  
✅ I'll create Week 2 cards during Week 1 (Mon-Thu)  
✅ I'll answer agent questions as they arise

### If You Choose Option B (All Cards First)

✅ I'll create remaining 18 cards systematically  
✅ Estimated 2-3 days to complete  
✅ Then full handoff to agents

### If You Choose Option C (Week 1+2 Cards)

✅ I'll create Week 2 cards tomorrow (9 cards)  
✅ Agents start Day 2 with Weeks 1-2 ready  
✅ Week 3-4 cards created during execution

2. **Objective**: Clear goal statement (what and why)
3. **Architecture Context**: How it fits in the system (1-2K words)
4. **Source Files**: Exact files to read with line numbers
5. **What to Build**: Complete directory structure
6. **Detailed Requirements**: Step-by-step specifications
7. **Implementation Patterns**: Code examples and patterns
8. **Testing Requirements**: Specific tests with commands
9. **Success Criteria**: Completion checklist
10. **Common Pitfalls**: What to avoid
11. **Handoff**: Dependencies and next steps

## 📞 YOUR DECISION

**I recommend Option A** (Start Week 1 immediately):
- Agents begin today
- Week 1 fully documented
- Week 2 cards created during Week 1
- Fastest path to Academy/Agency launch

**What do you think? Should I**:
1. ✅ **Create remaining Week 2 cards now** (9 cards, ~1 day work)
2. ✅ **Let agents start Week 1 today** and create Week 2 cards this week
3. ✅ **Create all remaining cards first** (18 cards, ~3 days work)

**Or would you like to**:
- Review the existing cards and provide feedback?
- Adjust the approach or timeline?
- Ask questions about any specific phase?
